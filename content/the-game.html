Copyright Debate: The Conference Game
=====================================

There are 52 cards in a deck. Each card refers to a single popular word 
used in the copyright debate. Prepare yourself beforehand: by reading 
the cards before the event and selecting cards containing words you 
expect to be used by the speakers. Every card in this deck has been 
tagged with appropriate alignment: chaotic (red), neutral (yellow) or 
lawful (green). The colors are to distinguish words which should be 
avoided from those which should be used extensively.

If the speaker uses a word to avoid, take the Chaotic (red) card and 
raise it over your head to make a point in the debate. If the speaker 
uses proper wording, take the proper Lawful (green) card to encourage 
him/her and to show your support. Use Neutral (yellow) cards to show 
the speakers that they are navigating murky linguistic waters. Even 
very few people in the conference room using the cards can raise 
awareness of the importance of the copyright language. Share your 
cards with others if you have enough and refer the peers to 
[copyspeak.org](/).
