{% block recommendations -%}

Use "free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”; indicate this context very clearly to avoid confusion

Use "libre" along with "free" to further stress the [freedom-based](/freedom) meaning

Use "gratis" instead of "free (as in beer)" to clearly demarcate freedoms from monetary cost
